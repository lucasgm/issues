msg: >
  The conditional check 'item.item.dest_path is search('\\.rpm$')' failed. The
  error was: error while evaluating conditional (item.item.dest_path is
  search('\\.rpm$')): 'dict object' has no attribute 'item'. 'dict object' has
  no attribute 'item'


  The error appears to be in
  '/runner/project/roles/deploy_service/tasks/service_download.yml': line 39,
  column 3, but may

  be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.


  The offending line appears to be:



  - name: Record completed RPM paths
    ^ here
_ansible_no_log: false
