Help me add support for "actionServerFilters" but making sure we do not break existing features and other properties
also need to figure out what other task files need to be updated.

serverFilters: [m4s-q35-cuaas-01, m4s-q35-cubas-01, m4s-q35-cucas-01]
actionServerFilters:
  HEALTH_CHECK: [not m4s-q35-cubas-01]  # Only cuaas-01 & cucas-01
  START: [not m4s-q35-cubas-01]         # Only cuaas-01 & cucas-01

serverFilters: [m4s-q35-cucas-01]
actionServerFilters:
  HEALTH_CHECK: [m4s-q35-cucas-01]      # Only cucas-01
  START: [m4s-q35-cucas-01]             # Only cucas-01

Requirements:
✅ Handles both formats: Direct hosts AND "not" expressions
✅ Optional property: Works when actionServerFilters absent
actionServerFilters should only override the phases that are explicitly defined within it. In your example, only HEALTH_CHECK and START have filters, so DOWNLOAD and INSTALL should use the default serverFilters.

In this example:
serverFilters: [m4s-q35-cuaas-01, m4s-q35-cubas-01, m4s-q35-cucas-01]
actionServerFilters:
  HEALTH_CHECK: [not m4s-q35-cubas-01]  # Only affects HEALTH_CHECK
  START: [not m4s-q35-cubas-01]         # Only affects START
lifecycle: [DOWNLOAD]  # No START/HEALTH_CHECK in lifecycle

Expected result:
Result:

DOWNLOAD: Uses serverFilters → All 3 hosts get DOWNLOAD
INSTALL: Uses serverFilters → All 3 hosts get INSTALL (auto-injected)
START: Not in lifecycle, so actionServerFilters.START is ignored
HEALTH_CHECK: Not in lifecycle, so actionServerFilters.HEALTH_CHECK is ignored

Expected Keyfeatures:
Key Features:
✅ Phase-specific filtering: Only affects phases that are both in lifecycle AND actionServerFilters
✅ Fallback behavior: Uses serverFilters for phases not in actionServerFilters
✅ Supports both formats: Direct hosts [host1] and exclusions [not host2]
✅ Dependency aware: Also applies to dependency injections
✅ Backward compatible: Works with existing execplans without actionServerFilters
